A Project for Udacity by Sven Schulz

WHAT IS IT?
-------------
This is a simple Google Maps viewer about the city Munich. I placed some markers and you can explore the city through the list navigation or on your own. The provided information and pictures comes from the Wikipedia API.

I used following packages:

	- knockout
	- gulp
	- expressJS
	- jade
	- stylus
	- superagent
	- browserify
	- nodemon
	- browser-sync

----------

INSTALL
-------------

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp pro` for production code
3. `gulp dev` for development code

Gulp will tell you what it does in the console.

Have Fun! :)
